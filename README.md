# Pipe Mania for FPGA

Pipe Mania for FPGA is a simple game programmed in VHDL, which was created as a study project at VUT Brno in 2014.
Now the game was released under the MIT license and will gradually be optimized for cheap FPGA board with Altera FPGA Cyclone II EP2C5T144 (for example: on Ebay for about $17).
